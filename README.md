# quantum_algorithms
Quantum algorithms that work on the IBM quantum systems.

1)Grover's algorithm
Algorithm that generates the quantum circuit for Grover's algorithm for given qubit number and number to be found and executes it.

2)Shor's algorithm
Creates Shor's algorithm for analysis of number 14 using given prime number.

3)Sudoku 4x4
Generates quantum circuit that finds solution of given sudoku.

HOW TO RUN
1) Download ipynb files
2) Go to quantum-computing.ibm.com and log in/sign up
3) Launch Quanum Lab
4) In Quanum Lab press the upload file icon
5) Choose the ipynb file you want to upload
6) After uploading open the file in Quantum Lab
7) If you want you can change some values in each file to change the variables. The values that can be changed have a corresponding comment
8) You can also change the system that the circuit will run on
9) On the tab Run press Run all cells
10) Results can be found at the bottom of the code
