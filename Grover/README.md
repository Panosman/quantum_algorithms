To run the algorithms use instructions in README on main directory.

GroverGeneral:
To run using different parameters change values of variables nqubits and solution
NOTE: The number in solution must be able to be represented with the number of qubits for the algorithm to work. Use positive numbers.


3qubits_Diagonal:
To run using different parameters change values of variables nqubits and solution
NOTE: The number in solution must be able to be represented with the number of qubits for the algorithm to work. Use positive numbers.
